# Credit Risk Analysis - Code Section Explanations

## üìù Cell-by-Cell Breakdown

### Cell 1: Environment Setup & Library Installation
```python
%pip install tf-nightly pyreadstat pandas matplotlib numpy
```
**Purpose**: 
- Installs cutting-edge machine learning libraries
- `tf-nightly`: Latest TensorFlow for neural networks
- `pyreadstat`: Handles SAS files (common in finance)
- Sets up warning suppression for clean output

**Why Important**: Creates a production-ready environment optimized for credit analysis

### Cell 2: Data Scientist Introduction (Markdown)
**Content**: Explains the data scientist's role in model validation and compliance
**Key Points**:
- Focus on model transparency and fairness
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Interpretable rule-based models

---

### Cell 3: Data Loading & Target Encoding
```python
heloc_url = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/TpQl93NfuzpDVAPaFzs8qg/heloc-dataset-v1.csv'
dataset['RiskPerformance'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(dataset['RiskPerformance'])
```
**What Happens**:
1. Loads HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) dataset from cloud
2. Converts text labels to numbers: "Good"‚Üí1, "Bad"‚Üí0
3. Shows class distribution to check for imbalance

**Business Impact**: Establishes the foundation for risk prediction using real financial data

---

### Cell 4: Feature Preprocessing
```python
scaler = RobustScaler()
X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X), columns=X.columns)
```
**Technical Details**:
- **RobustScaler**: Uses median/IQR instead of mean/std
- **Why Robust**: Preserves outliers (important in credit risk)
- **Stratified Split**: Maintains class proportions in train/test

**Credit Risk Context**: Outliers often represent high-risk cases we need to detect

---

### Cell 5: Feature Selection & Interpretable Model Training
```python
selector = SelectFromModel(LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', solver='liblinear'))
ebm = ExplainableBoostingClassifier()
lr = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1')
```
**Three-Step Process**:
1. **Feature Selection**: Reduces 23 features to most important ones
2. **EBM Training**: Glass-box model (fully interpretable)
3. **Logistic Regression**: Simple linear model for business rules

**Output**: Human-readable rules like "Higher income ‚Üí Lower risk"

---

### Cell 6: Model Evaluation & Rule Extraction
```python
ebm_perf = ROC(ebm.predict_proba).explain_perf(X_test, y_test)
lr_perf = ROC(lr.predict_proba).explain_perf(X_test, y_test)
```
**Performance Metrics**:
- **ROC Curves**: Shows true positive vs false positive rates
- **Feature Importance**: Ranks most influential credit factors
- **Business Rules**: Translates coefficients to plain English

**Regulatory Value**: Provides audit trail for every model decision

---

### Cell 7: Loan Officer Introduction (Markdown)
**Content**: Explains loan officer needs for practical decision-making
**Key Points**:
- Example-based explanations
- Comparable case analysis
- Actionable insights for lending decisions

---

### Cell 8: Data Preparation for Neural Networks
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
**Preparation for Deep Learning**:
- **StandardScaler**: Normalizes features for neural network training
- **Different from Previous**: Neural networks need different preprocessing
- **Same Dataset**: But prepared for more complex modeling

---

### Cell 9: Similar Applicant Finder Class
```python
class ApplicantExplainer:
    def __init__(self, X_train, y_train, feature_names, n_neighbors=5):
        self.nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)
```
**Case-Based Reasoning**:
- **k-Nearest Neighbors**: Finds 5 most similar historical applicants
- **Feature Comparison**: Shows how new applicant differs from similar cases
- **Distance Metrics**: Quantifies similarity between profiles

**Loan Officer Benefit**: "This applicant is similar to 5 previous customers who..."

---

### Cell 10: Neural Network Architecture
```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
**Architecture Explained**:
- **64 neurons**: First layer captures complex patterns
- **Dropout 0.2**: Prevents overfitting (20% random deactivation)
- **32 neurons**: Second layer refines patterns
- **1 output**: Final risk probability (0-1)

**Training Process**: 20 epochs with validation monitoring

---

### Cell 11: Example-Based Explanations
```python
def generate_explanation(applicant_id):
    feat_explanation, similar_profiles = explainer.explain(applicant_data)
```
**What This Does**:
1. Takes a new applicant's data
2. Finds 5 most similar historical cases
3. Shows feature-by-feature comparison
4. Displays risk outcomes of similar cases
5. Creates visualization of key metrics

**Visual Output**: Scatter plots comparing applicant to similar profiles

---

### Cell 12: Customer Introduction (Markdown)
**Content**: Explains customer need for clear, actionable explanations
**Key Points**:
- Contrastive explanations (why this decision, what could change it)
- Non-technical language
- Actionable improvement suggestions

---

### Cell 13: Contrastive Explainer Class
```python
class ContrastiveExplainer:
    def get_pertinent_positives(self, x, original_pred):
    def get_pertinent_negatives(self, x, original_pred):
```
**Two Key Methods**:

**Pertinent Positives**: 
- Features supporting current decision
- "Your credit score is better than typical bad applicants"

**Pertinent Negatives**:
- Changes that could flip the decision  
- "If you increase income by $10K, you might qualify"

---

### Cell 14: Contrastive Explanation Generation
```python
def generate_contrastive_explanation(applicant_id):
    pps = contrastive_explainer.get_pertinent_positives(applicant_data, original_pred)
    pns = contrastive_explainer.get_pertinent_negatives(applicant_data, original_pred)
```
**Customer-Friendly Output**:
- "Why you got this decision" (Pertinent Positives)
- "What could change the decision" (Pertinent Negatives)
- Plain English explanations
- Specific numerical recommendations

---

### Cell 15: Visual Contrastive Explanations
```python
def visualize_contrastive(applicant_id):
    # Bar charts showing your values vs typical values
    # Line plots showing required changes
```
**Two Types of Charts**:

1. **Bar Chart**: "Key Factors Supporting Your Decision"
   - Your values vs typical good/bad applicants
   - Shows strengths that led to approval/denial

2. **Line Chart**: "Changes Needed to Flip Decision"  
   - Current value ‚Üí Required value
   - Visual roadmap for improvement
